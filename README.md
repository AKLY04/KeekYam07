My name is Andrew Kobe Lee Yam, I am a Computer Science major in Digital Forensic student based on the Philippines. 
Even though my field specializes in the Digital Forensic area, my love for programming stays the same. At first, I
never know what programming felt like up until my very first HelloWorld application.

Right now, I create different java-based applications such as Android and Desktop applications and also as a backend 
server service for other application or website. I specializes in the backend development but with a proficient 
understanding and has a special interests towards to the frontend development.
